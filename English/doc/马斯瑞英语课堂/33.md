I was like if we spend a lot of time on English speaking can make progress on confidence.

After rejected by Alibaba's subsidiary, I was impressed. So, I consider getting a job at DaHua.

I've never worked in a big company before.

It seems like the log in as meaning as the sign in.

So one week ago I saw an ad for a new game on Youtube, I was like bro this game looks super fun.

It's a new type of game I've never tried before.

So I logged in to my Steam and clicked the purhase button with excitement.

A few hours later it was downloaded and fully installed.

I open the game, and the starting CG and the initial UI left me with a great impression.

I then started the campaign and played it for a while.

I gotta say I was super impressed by the next-generation graphics and the latest effects, and the story is deep and intersting too!

I literally wanna spend all my spare time on this game.

I even considered getting a new Xbox controller so I could play it while I'm in bed.

Sadly if I stare at the screen for too long I get headaches.

So every day I'm make small progress on the campaign.

I guess we should try to have a rational and reasonable attitude regarding new things, rather than just rejecting them.

When you think critically, but give it a chance, it might open doors to a whole new world.
